The substance we are specifically referring to is raw honey – honey in its <span style='color: #f4cc2b;'>purest form</span>; honey that has not been filtered, strained or heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit.<br/><br/>Many of the commercial varieties we find lined in our conventional grocery store shelves have been so processed that many (if not all) of the beneficial enzymes, nutrients and antioxidants have been completely destroyed."
